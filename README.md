# Mad2

The poor man's system for tracking file metadata.

### What?? Why?

Because I could not find anything remotely useful.

### What does Mad2 do?

It trakcs file metadata. Basically - it creates a single sidecar file per file tracked. The dataformat used in YAML.



Yeah, what exactly? There are a few overblown, high end solutions that I did not want to use.
